L-SPARC COMPILER SPECIFICATION

1. FUNCTIONALITY

The compiler translates an L program into a SPARC program. For example, the compiler should be able to convert
https://github.com/iensen/LtoASPtranslator/blob/master/compiler_examples/simplified_safety.l
into
https://github.com/iensen/LtoASPtranslator/blob/master/compiler_examples/simplified_safety.sparc

For more detail, L spec is at
https://github.com/iensen/LtoASPtranslator/blob/master/L_spec.pdf
and SPARC manual is at
https://github.com/iensen/sparc/blob/master/User_Manual/Sparc_Manual.pdf

2. MODULES

The compiler comprises three modules: L-parser, L-SPARC translator, and SPARC-unparser.

L-parser reads an L program and generates a list of L parse trees. L-parser is introduced at
https://github.com/iensen/LtoASPtranslator/blob/master/README.txt
L-parser is based on a generic parser whose spec is located at
https://github.com/iensen/genparser/blob/master/docs/main/astgen.pdf

L-SPARC translator converts a list of L-parse trees into a list of SPARC parse trees.

SPARC-unparser reads a list of SPARC parse trees and creates a SPARC program.
