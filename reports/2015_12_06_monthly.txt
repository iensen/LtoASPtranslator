L-ASP TRANSLATOR: 2015/12/06 MONTHLY REPORT

After the 2015/11/01 monthly report, these L constructs:
    Were translated into SPARC:
        Constant declarations
        Maybe literals
    Were thoroughly discussed and are being translated (should be done soon):
        Modulo operation
        Arithmetic expressions in set constructs
        Cardinality constraints
    Need to wait for new version of SPARC:
        Negative integers
    Need more discussion:
        Empty type
