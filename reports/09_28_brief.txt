L-ASP TRANSLATOR: 09/28 BRIEF REPORT

Notes:
    Please use a text viewer which supports optional word wrap
    This GitHub repository can be downloaded:
        https://github.com/iensen/LtoASPtranslator/archive/master.zip
    It can also be cloned in desktop:

In addition to what could be translated from L to ASP as of the 09/07 monthly report, we add:
    Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
    Comparison operators: =, !=, <, <=, >, >=
    Set expressions:
        Ranges: {m..n}
        Constructors:
            With the form: 
                func(Var_1,...,Var_n) where Var_1 in type_1,...,Var_n in type_n
            For example:
                f(V2, V1, V2) where V1 in t1, V2 in t2
    
To sum up what has been done so far:
    We can only translate an L program in which:
        (1) Integers are nonnegative
        (2) Terms are either:
                Constants
                    or
                Ground functional terms 
                    or
                Basic variables
                    or
                Basic typed variables
        (3) A set expression is either:
                A nonempty set, such as: {a, 2, f(0)}
                    or
                A range
                    or
                A constructor of the form: f(V1,...,Vn) where V1 in t1,...,Vn in tn
                    or
                A type name, such as: type1
                    or
                A union/intersection/difference of set expressions
        (4) Rules are already in ASP-form, such as:
                p0 or p1(type1 X) if p2(X, f(2)) and not p3(a, 2, X).
    Also, this L feature is not supported yet:
        A functional term which has a functional proper subterm
