L-ASP TRANSLATOR: 2015/12/22 BRIEF REPORT

Newly translated L constructs:
    Modulo operation
    Arithmetic expressions in set constructs
    Cardinality constraints

Notes:
    (1) Using Closed-World Assumption for each predicate. May change later
    (2) After translation to ASP, displaying only positive literals in models
    (3) When collecting ground terms from L rules to declare in Sparc,
        translator misses some terms in certain cases. Will fix soon
    (4) Empty type is currently unsupported
    (5) Negative integers are currently unsupported in SPARC
