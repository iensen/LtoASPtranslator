L-ASP TRANSLATOR: 10/04 MONTHLY REPORT

In addition to what could be translated from L to ASP as of the 09/28 brief report, we add:
    Non-quantified rules with mixed negation/conjunction/disjunction, such as:
        not (p0(t1 X1, t2 X2, t3 X3) or p1(X3, X2, X1)) if 
            p2(X1) or p3(a, X2, X3) and p4.

To sum up what has been done so far:
    We can only translate an L program in which:
        (1) Integers are nonnegative
        (2) Terms are either:
                Constants
                    or
                Ground functional terms 
                    or
                Basic variables
                    or
                Basic typed variables
        (3) A set expression is either:
                A nonempty set
                    or
                A range
                    or
                A constructor of the form: f(V1,...,Vn) where V1 in t1,...,Vn in tn
                    or
                A type name
                    or
                A union/intersection/difference of set expressions
    Also, this L feature is not supported yet:
        A functional term which has a functional proper subterm 

The module which converts a propositional formula to conjunctive/disjunctive normal form is:
    src/normalizer.py
        
On how to run the translator, please consult: docs/translator_spec.txt
        
Examples are .sp files in: src/examples/. Especially:
    formula_rules
    ch5_simple
    student_evaluation
