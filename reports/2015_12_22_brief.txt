L-ASP TRANSLATOR: 2015/12/22 BRIEF REPORT

Newly translated L constructs:
    Modulo operation
    Arithmetic expressions in set constructs
    Cardinality constraints

Notes:
    Negative integers need new version of SPARC
    Empty type is currently unsupported
    Using Closed-World Assumption for each predicate. May change later
    After translation to ASP, displaying only positive literals in models
