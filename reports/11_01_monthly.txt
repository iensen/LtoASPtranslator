L-ASP TRANSLATOR: 11/01 MONTHLY REPORT

In addition to what could be translated from L to ASP as of the 10/04 monthly report, we add:
    (1) Abitrary set constructors
    (2) Nested functional terms
    (3) Quantified terms of the form:
            <quantifier> <type_name>

As of now, the unsupported L constructs are:
    (1) Quantified terms of the form:
            some <type_name> <variable_name>
    (2) Constant declarations
    (3) Cardinality constraints
    (4) Maybe literals
    (5) Empty types
    (6) Negative integers
