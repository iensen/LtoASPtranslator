L-ASP TRANSLATOR: ISSUES

Distribution:
    Making the L solver an Eclipse plug-in fragment to integrate with the L editor.

Sparc-related matters:
    Empty types:
        Empty sorts are currently unsupported in Sparc. 
        Tricky to translate L programs with empty types into 
        ASP programs without empty sorts.
    Negative integers:
        Terms which are evaluated to negative integers are currently unsupported in Sparc.

Notes:
    Closed-World Assumption:
        CWA for each possible predicate atom. May change.
    Negation:
        L negation is ASP strong negation.
        Currently forbid negation of:
            Non-trivial sentences: not p / p and q / p or q.
            Quantified atoms: p(every t) / q(some t).
