L-ASP TRANSLATOR: ISSUES

Errors:
    #rule_gterms:
        From L rules, the translator grounds then collects terms 
        to define the ASP sort #rule_gterms. 
        But the translator misses variables (which are possibly subterms of
        functional or arithmetic terms).
    Empty type:
        Currently unsupported.
    Negative integers:
        Terms which represent negative integers are currently unsupported in Sparc.
        
Notes:
    Closed-World Assumption:
        CWA for each predicate. May change.
        
Improvements:
    Selective grounding:
        L quantified terms [every/some typeName] are transformed into ASP ground terms.
        But L universally/existentially quantified terms in heads/sentences should 
        be transformed into ASP variables, which are quantified implicitly. 
        Doing so will reduce the needed time and space, especially when 
        putting transformed rules in conjunctive/disjunctive normal form.
