L-ASP TRANSLATOR SPECIFICATION

The translator is found at:
https://github.com/iensen/LtoASPtranslator/blob/master/src/translator.py
Using a command-line interface:
    1.  Change the directory to: src
    2.  Provide an input L program and request an output ASP program:
            python translator.py <path_to_input_file> [> path_to_output_file]
For example:
    cd/d E:/LtoASPtranslator/src
    python translator.py file_L                     (print on screen)
    python translator.py file_L     >   file_ASP    (overwrite output file)
    python translator.py file_L     >>  file_ASP    (append to output file)

1. DESCRIPTION

Given an L program, the translator produces a semantically equivalent ASP program.

Manual demos of such translations can be found at:
https://github.com/iensen/LtoASPtranslator/tree/master/docs/demos

Automated examples are located at:
https://github.com/iensen/LtoASPtranslator/tree/master/src/examples
(look for pairs of .l and .sp files)

L spec is provided at:
https://github.com/iensen/LtoASPtranslator/blob/master/Lspec/Lspec.pdf
ASP manual is given here:
https://github.com/iensen/sparc/blob/master/User_Manual/Sparc_Manual.pdf

2. MODULES

The translator has three modules: parser, transformer, and unparser. The control flow is:
    L program
        |
        |   parser
        |
        V
    parsed L program
        |
        |   transformer
        |
        V
    parsed ASP program
        |
        |   unparser
        |
        V
    ASP program
    
2.1. PARSER

This module parses an L program. The output is a list of parsed L statements, each of which represents either an L constant declaration, type declaration, or rule.

This L parser is introduced at:
https://github.com/iensen/LtoASPtranslator/blob/master/README.txt

The form of a parsed L program is described in the spec of a generic parser:
https://github.com/iensen/genparser/blob/master/docs/main/astgen.pdf
The L lexicon and grammar in use are located at:
https://github.com/iensen/LtoASPtranslator/tree/master/src

2.2. TRANSFORMER

From a parsed L program produced by the parser, the transformer outputs a parsed ASP program.

The form of a parsed ASP program is detailed at:
https://github.com/iensen/genparser/blob/master/docs/main/astgen.pdf
The ASP lexicon and grammar are here:
https://github.com/iensen/LtoASPtranslator/tree/master/src

The transformer has two submodules: rewriter and reassembler. The control flow is:
    parsed L program
        |
        |   (preprocessing: list_to_dict)
        |
        |   rewriter
        |
        V
    incomplete dictionary parsed ASP program
        |
        |   reassembler
        |
        |   (postprocessing: dict_to_list)
        |
        V
    parsed ASP program
    
Note: The pre- and post- processing functions alter the data type (list/dictionary) of a program to meet the specific need (consistency/convenience).

2.2.1. REWRITER

An input of the rewriter is a dictionary parsed L program. This module rewrites an L [constant declaration / type declaration / rule] into an ASP [constant definition / sort definition / rule]. The output is an incomplete dictionary parsed ASP program.

This "ASP program" is incomplete because:

    (1)
        In L, ground terms in rules are unrequired to be members of declared types.
        But in ASP, such terms must be members of defined sorts.

    (2)
        L has no syntax for declaring predicates.
        Yet ASP requires such declarations.

This lack will be remedied by the following submodule: reassembler.

2.2.2. REASSEMBLER

The reassembler intakes an incomplete dictionary parsed ASP program from the previous submodule. Then it outputs a dictionary parsed ASP program.

The reassembler remedies its incomplete "ASP program" input by:

    (1)
        Defining the sort #rule_gterms, whose members are ground terms extracted from rules.
        
    (2)
        Declaring predicates found in rules. In detail:
            
            (a)
                Define the sort #types, which is the union of defined sorts rewritten from declared types.
                
            (b)
                Define the sort #universal, which is the union of the sorts #types and #rule_gterms.
                
            (c)
                For instance, if a rule has a predicate p with arity 2, then declare it as: p(#universal, #universal).

2.3. UNPARSER

Given a parsed ASP program from the transformer, this module writes the corresponding ASP program.
